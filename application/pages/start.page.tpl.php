		<p>The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin.  Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.</p>
		<p>First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes.  These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz.  As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered:</p>
		<p>"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?"</p>
		<p>"Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me."</p>
		<p>"Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, "although he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from.  Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested.  At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence."</p>
